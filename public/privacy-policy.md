# Privacy Policy for CleanCoin

**Last Updated: January 6, 2026**

## Introduction

Welcome to CleanCoin ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience when using our mobile application ("App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our CleanCoin sobriety tracking application.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access the App.

## Information We Collect

### Information Stored Locally on Your Device

CleanCoin is designed with privacy as a core principle. **All your personal data is stored locally on your device** and is not transmitted to our servers. This includes:

- **Sobriety Start Dates**: The dates you set for tracking your sobriety journey for each habit
- **Habit Information**: Names, colors, and configurations of habits you track
- **Progress Data**: Your streak information, earned coins, and milestone achievements
- **App Preferences**: Your display settings and preferences within the App

### Information We Do NOT Collect

We want to be transparent about what we do NOT collect:

- We do NOT collect your name, email address, or contact information
- We do NOT collect location data
- We do NOT collect health or medical information beyond what you voluntarily enter
- We do NOT track your behavior or usage patterns
- We do NOT use analytics or tracking tools
- We do NOT share any data with third parties
- We do NOT use advertising or ad tracking

## How Your Data is Stored

### Local Storage Only

All data entered into CleanCoin is stored exclusively on your device using your device's local storage capabilities. This means:

- Your data never leaves your device
- Your data is not backed up to our servers
- Your data is not synchronized across devices
- If you uninstall the App, your data will be permanently deleted

### Data Security

While we do not store your data on external servers, we recommend:

- Keeping your device secure with a passcode, fingerprint, or face recognition
- Keeping your device's operating system up to date
- Not sharing your device with others if you want to keep your sobriety journey private

## How We Use Your Information

Since all data remains on your device, we do not use your personal information for any purpose. The App processes your data locally to:

- Display your sobriety progress and day counts
- Track and display earned milestone coins
- Calculate and award monthly sobriety coins
- Show your habit streaks and progress

## Data Retention

Your data is retained on your device for as long as you have the App installed. You can delete your data at any time by:

- Using the reset function within the App settings for individual habits
- Deleting habits through the App settings
- Uninstalling the App (this will permanently delete all data)

## Children's Privacy

CleanCoin is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
